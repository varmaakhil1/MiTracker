3. System Architecture
A. User Interaction Flow
Frontend (WordPress + WooCommerce)

Customers visit the store, buy a GPS tracker, and subscribe to a plan.
They log in to their account (stored in WordPress).
The system assigns them a unique Traccar user ID.
Backend (Traccar Integration)

Each GPS device has a SIM card (GPRS network) that sends location data.
Devices communicate with the Traccar server (TCP/UDP).
Traccar stores location data in a database (H2 or MySQL).
User Dashboard

Customers log in to WordPress and see their GPS devices in their account.
WordPress fetches real-time tracking data from Traccar API.
WooCommerce manages subscriptions (access control based on plan).
B. Docker-Based Deployment
To isolate services and scale easily, use Docker Compose with three main containers:

WordPress + WooCommerce
Traccar GPS Tracking Server
MySQL Database
